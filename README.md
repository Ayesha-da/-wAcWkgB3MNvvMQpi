### Background:

We are one of the fastest growing startups in the logistics and delivery domain. We work with several partners and make on-demand delivery to our customers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we are facing several different challenges and everyday we are trying to address these challenges.

We thrive on making our customers happy. As a growing startup, with a global expansion strategy we know that we need to make our customers happy and the only way to do that is to measure how happy each customer is. If we can predict what makes our customers happy or unhappy, we can then take necessary actions.

Getting feedback from customers is not easy either, but we do our best to get constant feedback from our customers. This is a crucial function to improve our operations across all levels.

We recently did a survey to a select customer cohort. You are presented with a subset of this data. We will be using the remaining data as a private test set.

### Goal(s):

Predict if a customer is happy or not based on the answers they give to questions asked.

### Success Metrics:

Reach 73% accuracy score or above, or convince why the solution provided is better.

### Bonus(es):

- Find which questions/features are more important when predicting a customerâ€™s happiness. Using a feature selection approach explain what is the minimal set    of attributes/features that would preserve the most information about the problem while increasing predictability of the data. 
- Is there any question that can be removed in next survey?
